## __User Experience__

### __Project Goals__

The decided to create Rave Reivews based on my love for Drum and Bass as teenager and into my early 20's. Me and my friends are 
always discussing raves we've been to and the sets from them. Sharing on tunea and sets so I thought it would be great to have a place 
all these recordings and memories could be stored.

In a sense this would be like a facebook page but specifally for Drum and Base enthusiasts where they can review raves, 
comment on others and share their favourtie sets.

### __User Stories__

#### __Target Audience__

Target audience is for anyone with in interest in Drum and Base, while raves are for 18 year olds an over, the age one appreciate the music and experiences 
from fellow enthusiasts is any age so it would be restrictive to set a specific target audience. That said, I would imagine it will appeal mostly to those aged 16 - 50 as those are the ages that will have experienced joys of Drum and Bass and the raves most.

## __Design__

### __Appearance & Colour Scheme__

My aim is to make the site feel urban / street as Drum and Bass (DnB) is raw music genre with it's roots firmly set in the poorer areas of UK cities.
I designed my own logo in Illustrator and used oranges against dark grey and black as my colours reflecting the bright energy the music brings and the dark
and shady venues Dnb raves are held at. The 'DnB' is only used for the home page and I created a brigt electric blue styling for this to emulate the 
light shows and lasers you get in a rave.

### __Typography__

To continue the urban theme I chose a graphiti style font called 'PhillySans' and for main written text and a strong and easy-to-read 
sans serif font from the Google Fonts Library called 'Merriweather Sans'.

### __Imagery__

As the members of Rave Reviews are able and encouraged to upload their own images have kept the site free from too many images. 
The times that images are used they are of pictures I taken from raves I've attended.

### __Wireframes__

Wireframes have been designed for mobile, tablet and desktop.
