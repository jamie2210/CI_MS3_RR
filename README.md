## User Experience

### Project Goals

The decided to create Rave Reivews based on my love for Drumn and Bass as teenager and into ym early 20's. Me and my friends are 
always discussing raves we've been to and the sets from them. Sharing on tunea and sets so I thought it would be great to have a place 
all these recordings and memories could be stored.

In a sense this would be like a facebook page but specifally for drum and base enthusiasts where they can review raves, 
comment on others and share their favourtie sets.
